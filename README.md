# Convex Hull Algorithms
This project is for implementation of Jarvis March and Graham's scan algorithms for final project of Computational Geometry course.

##  Setup

This project has been developed on `Python 3.8` and can be installed by `pip`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/farinamhz/convex-hull-algorithms.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command installs compatible versions of the required libraries.

##  Quickstart
There are two options for running the project which are explained below:
1. Manual test case file:
```bash
python convex_hull.py Test-Filename.txt
```
- Test-Filename can be any test file created in txt format. In fact, we provide the path of the file for the command.
- There are some test files containing different scenarios for the points next to the code in the GitHub repository, which are named test1.txt, test2.txt, test3.txt, test4.txt, and test5.txt.



2. Random test cases by entering the number of points:
```bash
python convex_hull.py Random-Number
```
- Random-Number can be an integer which is the number of points in the set. In fact, we provide the path of the file for the command.
